# 👋 Hi, I'm Nandini Sinha

### Senior Backend & Cloud Engineer | Distributed Systems | DevOps | Scalable Infrastructure

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with **5+ years of professional experience** designing, building, and scaling **cloud-native, production-grade systems**. I work across the stack of **backend engineering, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, IaC, DevOps automation, and system design** — with a strong focus on **resilience, performance, and developer productivity**.

I enjoy solving deep technical problems, improving platform reliability, and building modular, well-crafted systems that scale.

## 🚀 What I Do

* **Backend Engineering:** Golang, Node.js, Python, REST/gRPC/GraphQL API design
* **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, IoT Core, EKS, S3, Kinesis, Timestream), Terraform, Jenkins, GitLab CI
* **Distributed Systems:** Event-driven architectures, IoT ingestion pipelines, microservices
* **Developer Productivity:** Internal CLI tools (Cobra CLI), automation, configuration systems
* **DevOps & Reliability:** Docker, Kubernetes, Vault, monitoring/alerting (Grafana, Loki), performance testing (JMeter)
* **System Design:** Scalability, high availability, caching, data modeling, security & observability
* **Mentorship & Leadership:** Feature ownership, L3 system design, training engineers, participating in hiring loops

## 🔧 Featured Work

Here are projects that represent my engineering focus (backend + cloud + infra):

* **Cloud-native Microservice Boilerplate (Go/Node)**
  A production-style template with clean architecture, REST/gRPC, logging, tracing, Docker, and CI/CD.

* **IoT Telemetry Pipeline (Serverless + Streaming)**
  Lambda + IoT Core + DynamoDB + Kinesis + Timestream → real-time ingestion + analytics.

* **Infrastructure-as-Code Templates**
  Terraform templates for secure AWS deployments, IAM automation, CI/CD pipelines, and environment bootstrapping.

* **Developer Productivity CLI (Golang Cobra)**
  Modular CLI implementing typed config, concurrency-safe operations, error propagation, and task automation.

*(More projects coming soon — refactoring existing private/older projects for public release.)*
